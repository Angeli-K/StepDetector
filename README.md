# Real-time step detection

Implementation of a real-time step detection using the integrated sensors of a head-mounted display. Four different approaches were developed, using acceleration, velocity and position signals. Additionally a Gaussian low-pass filter was used in order to reject the high-frequency noise. 

Currently the step detection works with an Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (Oculus Runtime SDK 0.8.0.0) and game engine Unity5 (Version 5.3.4).
